Feature: Users api
  User represents someone with access to our system. Users can have
  the role 'admin' or 'user'. Users with role 'user' can only access resources
  created by themselves.

  Background:
    Given the path prefix is "/v1"
    Given a user with id "5cf37266-3473-4006-984f-9325122678b7" and password "gophers"
